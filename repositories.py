# The first step of any project is to create a repo
# A git repo represents a single project

# A repo is essentially a directory that contains a project and a hidden .git directory where git stores
# all of it's internal tracking and versioning info for the project.


# To initialize a git a repo, go into an empty directory and run git init. This creates a hidden .git
# directory in your project directory
