# Git is the most popular VCS (version control system).
# It allows you to keep a history of code changes
# Revert mistakes in your code.
# Collab with other devs
# Make backups of your code
# etc...

# Git allows you to track code changes over time by author with a set of commands to search, manipulate,
# and revert history.
# Git creates a commit, a set of changes tied to an author, time of day, and other info.
# As many commits as you want can be added to the main line
# At any commit you can branch off and create new commits on the new line
# Any branch can be merged into any other branch, including the main line
# Commits can be squashed into one commit
# Commit messages can be edited.
# Commits can also be reverted


# Check out the git manual with: man git
# commands to navigate:
# j/k: up/down
# q: quit
# d: half page down
# u: half page up
# /<term>: search for term
# n: next search term
# N: last search term



# Git has two categories of commands; porcelain(high-level), and plumbing(low-level).
# Porcelain commands will be used most often to interact with your code.

# Commands such as these are porcelain:
# git status
# git add
# git commit
# git push
# git pull
# git log

# Some plumbing commands are:
# git apply
# git commit-tree
# git hash-object



# You need to assign a name and email to your git config so the author of gits can be tracked

# To check they are set:
# git config --get user.name
# git config --get user.email
