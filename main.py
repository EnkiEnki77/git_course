# Git is the most popular VCS (version control system).
# It allows you to keep a history of code changes
# Revert mistakes in your code.
# Collab with other devs
# Make backups of your code
# etc...

# Git allows you to track code changes over time by author with a set of commands to search, manipulate,
# and revert history.
# Git creates a commit, a set of changes tied to an author, time of day, and other info.
# As many commits as you want can be added to the main line
# At any commit you can branch off and create new commits on the new line
# Any branch can be merged into any other branch, including the main line
# Commits can be squashed into one commit
# Commit messages can be edited.
# Commits can also be reverted


# Check out the git manual with: man git

# j/k: up/down
# q: quit

# u: half page up
# /<term>: search for term
# n: next search term
