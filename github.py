# Github is the most popular website for hosting remote git repositories.

# It serves as a backup of all your code on the cloud in case you lose your computer
# A central place to share your code and collaborate with others
# A public portfolio for all your coding projects

# In github you can create remote repo's hosted on their servers, and then initialize a local repo on
# your machine and connect it to the remote.
